# QQHsm-Switch-Dart
Sample of GUI app uses the HSM description as an external resource.

## Introduction
The project demonstrates the use of the approach proposed in https://github.com/mk590901/QQHsm-Dart in a regular GUI application.

## App description
The application simulates the operation of a __switch__. It is controlled by two events: __TURN__ and __RESET__. Event __TURN__ switches the scheme from the __ON__ to __OFF__ state and back, and event __RESET__ resets the state machine to the __OFF__ state regardless of what state the state machine was in before.
